## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
library(stringr)
library(glue)
```
```{r}
thatsAlright <- 
  jsonlite::fromJSON(
    "https://www.dropbox.com/s/f3ox7rd5favr0o0/thatsAlright.json?dl=1"
  )
```

```{r}
View(thatsAlright)
```
```{r}
# 字串向量長度
length(c("I will"))
# 每個元素值有幾個字元(包含符號與空格)
str_length(c("I will"))
```
